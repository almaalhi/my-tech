## Page refresh

This page was initially made with very little planning. I just wanted a place to share code. Now that some time has passed, I think I'd like to completely refresh this page with just a short 'About me' section and then links to more full projects.

As of now, I don't know when I'll start the refresh but the seed has been planted. Writing it down somewhere (Here) also will serve as a modivator.
